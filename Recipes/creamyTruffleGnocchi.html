    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A delicious, creamy, and rich gnocchi recipe that can be eaten alone, or paired with a perfect protein of your choice.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>17 ounces pre made gnocchi pasta</li>
        <li>4 slices of bacon</li>
        <li>3 cloves of garlic</li>
        <li>1/4 cup fresh basic + 3 leaves for sprinkling at the end</li>
        <li>1 tsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tsp truffle balsamic</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>parmigiano reggiano cheese to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by chopping up 3 cloves of garlic and a 1/4 cup of basil. They can be roughly chopped. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Then, cube your bacon and fry it in a pan on medium-high heat until it’s crispy and cooked through. Set it aside on a paper towel to drain any excess grease.</li>
        <li>Add your herbs back into the pot and cook down until your garlic looks golden.</li>
        <li>Turn your heat down. Pour in your heavy cream, truffle balsamic and olive oil. stir and give the ingredients about 5 minutes to simmer together.</li>
        <li>Add in your gnocchi and cook according to the package (mine specified 2-3 minutes). You’ll know they fully cooked when you pierce them and they have an even color and texture. If in doubt 2-4 minutes is the rule of thumb.</li>
        <li>The cream sauce will start to thicken because of the starches from the pasta. You want that deliciousness!</li>
        <li>Turn off your heat, and top with bacon and a little bit of fresh basil. Grate in Parmigiano Reggiano to taste.</li>
    </ol>
